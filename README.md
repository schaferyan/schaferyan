### ðŸ‘‹**Hello, I'm Ryan Schafer**

I'm a software developer with a focus on Java. I've built applications for Android, JavaFX, and the web. I'm hoping to find long term employment in the industry soon, but I am also excited to get involved in some open source projects. My BA was in English and I took a Technical Writing source, so if your project needs documentation, I may be able to help.
