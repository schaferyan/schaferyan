### ðŸ‘‹**Hello, I'm Ryan Schafer**

I'm open to short term and long term software developement work opportunities. 

I currently volunteer with DemocracyLab, providing front-end bug fixes. I'm also a freelance web developer, helping clients to accurately represent their brand identity through websites and custom mobile apps. 

Besides seeking a professional development role, I'm looking to further expand my horizons, and gain experience working collaboratively on interesting projects. I'm inspired by the collaborative, co-creation based world of the open-source community, and I would love to learn about any open-source projects that could use my help.

My BA was in English and I have Technical Writing training - if your project needs documentation, I can help. 

You can learn more about me by visitng [my developer profile website](https://ryanschafer.dev/). Currently the best way to reach me is by emailing me at contact@ryanschafer.dev.
