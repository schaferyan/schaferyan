ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Ryan Schafer.

I write Android and Desktop Software applications in Java, recently most of my work has been on the Android Developement platform. I've also had some training in web developement. 

A love for creative problem solving and a passion for exploring what technology can accomplish are what drew me to coding. The collaborative and ever more expansive world of open source 
technology inspires me every day. I'm hoping to find long term employment in the industry soon, but I am also excited to get involved in some exciting open source projects.

I'd especially love to collaborate on any social justice or music related coding projects. 
I'm also interested in projects related to writing, editing, and publishing, and have an eye for good written content - my Bachelar's was in Creative Writing.
