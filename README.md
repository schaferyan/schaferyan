### ðŸ‘‹**Hello, I'm Ryan Schafer**

I'm a software developer with strong Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS fundamentals and a knack for learning and implementing new technologies, frameworks, and paradigms. I derive a feeling of immense satisfaction from solving challenging technical dilemmas. My love for solving complex problems, applying logic, and making things work is what drew me to a programming career. 

Since deciding to become a professional software developer in 2020, I've worked hard to expand my programming knowledge through a rigorous self-taught curriculum of online classes, free tutorials, books, and independent projects. I'm prepared to take my learning journey to it's next logical step - getting involved professionally and joining a company in a junior, apprentice or intern role. 

I enjoy front end work and have particularly enjoyed building applications with React.js. I've also taken pleasure in writing efficient business logic in Java, building Restful API's with Node.js and Express.js, and building Android applications in Java. 

Besides seeking a professional development role, I'm looking to further expand my horizons, and gain experience working collaboratively on interesting projects. I'm inspired by the collaborative, co-creation based world of the open-source community, and I would love to hear about any open-source projects that could use my help.

My BA was in English and I have Tehnical Writing training - if your project needs documentation, I can help. 

Currently the best way to reach me is by emailing me at contact@ryanschafer.dev.
